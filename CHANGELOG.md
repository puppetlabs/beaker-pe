(QENG-5095) Use `current` endpoint for frictionless agent

Previous to this commit, the url constructed for frictionless agent
installs attempted to use the hosts `pe_ver` variable for getting the
exact URL of the simplified install script. This was causing issues with
PEZ builds due to the different pe_ver in the filename (for downloading
the tarball) and the actual pe version.
This commit updates the url to just use the `current` endpoint instead
of the version, which mimics our install documentation. This won't
really remove the ability of installing an older version via this method
considering the logic for adding pe_repo classes didn't support passing
a specific pe_ver / agent version to pe_repo.

(QENG-5040) Run puppet after simplified mono install

Previous to this commit, the new simplified mono install method was not
running puppet on the master node in a mono only scenario. If the
install included agents not of the masters OS, then puppet would of been
ran due to needing to add pe_repo classes. In the scenario of mono
master only, if puppet is not ran, then setup is not considered complete
due to exported resources, mcollective and facts not being setup yet.
This would cause numerous issues, such as no facts in puppetdb (so
anyaltic tests for example would fail) until a test somewhere in the
pipeline ran puppet agent on the master node.
This commit adds a call outside of the parallel agent run on non infra
agents due to the fact that with exported resources, the classifier
service will restart, so need to run the master first, then after that
all the agents can run.
```
* (maint) Fix parallel agent install (19c1e64a)


```
(maint) Fix parallel agent install
Parallel agent installs have been broken since f9cb3ca802ddc94a9a42dcbcfef96f7a76a19dff because the install command contained a working_dir that was unique per host.
This fixes that issue and also allows all agents to be installed in parallel regardless of OS or unique installer_cmd

PE-20610 Fix install failure on windows for old pe versions

Added logic to use the old generic_install method on windows when
installing old pe versions that requires an msi install because of
powershell2 issue PE-18351. The newly added simple_monolithic_install
does not have a check for those conditions and proceeds with

(PE-20589) After a simple monolithic install run puppet on non-infrastructure agents

Previously after agents were installed via simple mono install, we ran the agents
all at once. This include the master. Occasionaly there would be a change done to
the console services that would require a restart.
This would cause other agent runs to fail. So to not have that happen, we will run
only the non-infrastructure agents. That should be fine since part of the process
of installing PE should have the puppet runs included there.

This caused unix machines to install on just the root directory and
caused failures on windows.

(maint) Properly install pe-client-tools when using a tag version

Previously, installing pe-client-tools with a tag version would fail on
Windows/OS X and install the wrong package on Linux.

When installing pe-client-tools, we provide two options:
- pe_client_tools_sha: the commit SHA of the version to install
- pe_client_tools_version: the `git describe` of the version to install

pe_client_tools_version is always the name of the package to install.
But the *location* of the package differs based on whether the package
version corresponds to a tag or not. When the package isn't a tag
version, it's located in a directory named based on the SHA. But when it
is a tag version, it's located in a directory named after the tag.

When pe_client_tools_version was specified as a tag, we would look in
the directory named after the SHA (which was actually from a *previous*
build of the package, from before it was tagged) for a file named after
the tag. That file would never be there, since we had a mismatch of
directory and filename. For Windows and OS X, this caused a failure to
install, because they need to know the exact filename.

This case incidentally *worked* (or appeared to work) on Linux
platforms, because they never actually refer to the package by
filename. Instead, they install the package by setting up a repo config,
which *is* always named after pe_client_tools_sha, and never
pe_client_tools_version. In that case, the Linux platforms would
actually install the previous version of the package by SHA, from before
it had been tagged.

We now properly handle the case where pe_client_tools_version is a tag,
by using that version as the location of the file in addition to the
filename.

Due to the timing of our LTS releases and our new major branches, PE 2016.5.0 and

This means we need to not attempt to install fricitonlessly if it is pe 2016.5.(0|1)
if the agent platform is windows2008r2.
This PR adjust the install_via_msi? method and refactors the logic in there to clean
it up a bit (it is getting tough to easily read).
It breaks the method down to three lines:
1. If the agent is older then PE 2016.4.0.
2. If the agent is windows2008r2 and is less then 2016.4.3
3. If the agent is windows2008r2 and the agent version is between 2016.4.99 and 2016.5.99.
If any of those are true then the MSI method should be used to install the agent.

(BKR-806) Only add pe_repo classes once

Previously, if installing multiple agents with the same platform, the
work to add the appropriate pe_repo class to the master would be
performed once for each agent. Because that requires running `puppet
agent -t` on the master, it can add a significant amount of unnecessary
overhead to the install process when installing several agents.

We now check whether the class has already been included in the Beaker
Frictionless Agent group and skip running puppet on the master if it
has.

Previously, the simple_monolithic install method was installing agents,
stopping the agent service and then attempting to sign certificates.
This was failing sporadically because the agent service needs to run
enough to submit a certificate request before being stopped. This was
being handled properly in the generic install method, but the order of
operations was swapped in the monolithic install method.

(BKR-1058) Implement a simpler monolithic install method

Currently, the `do_install` method is a mega-method responsible for
installing and upgrading every version, layout, and platform of PE. It
knows how to handle masterless installs, legacy agent installs, and
extremely old versions of PE. Because of that legacy, it has some
inefficiencies and is inflexible.

Since the most common case by far is a simple monolithic or split PE
install with a set of frictionless agents, we can dramatically simplify
and therefore speed up the basic case. This commit implements a
determine_install_type method that will detect whether the task being
asked of it is one of those simple cases. The `do_install` method now
branches based on the type of install, calling
`simple_monolithic_install` for a basic monolithic + agents install, or
`generic_install` for everything else. Simple split installs are
currently detected, but not handled specially (they still fall back to
the generic install).

Doing away with some of the legacy concerns allows this method to be
much simpler and more efficient. In particular, because the method has a
defined task (mono master + agents, rather than a generic list of
hosts), it can be optimized around that task. This is accomplished now
by first installing the master, and then installing all the agents in
parallel. This method also removes an extra agent run that hasn't been
necessary since PE 3.3.

For a monolithic master with four frictionless agents, this new method
takes ~6 min 30 sec, compared to ~11 minutes before.

Prior to this commit we were essentially always passing in a config

I have instead made use of the `update_pe_conf` method to inject the
answers.

something tricky about nil, undef in hiera/lookup...it might be
applicable to a nodes.conf file where we wanted to clear a parameter on

during installation.

(PE-18516,PE-18170) Temporarily set pe.conf when upgrading to Flanders

At the moment, MEEP does not create a 2.0 pe.conf when recovering
configuration for an upgrade.  This is preventing all upgrade tests from
PE >= 2016.2 (when meep was introduced) to PE >= 2017.1 from completing
because meep ends up using a 1.0 pe.conf that has no node_roles. Without
the node_roles information, the node is not considered infrastructure,
and meep's enc returns no classes for it, so nothing happens in the
upgrade apply.

This is not currently a problem upgrading from < 2016.2 because
beaker-pe is providing the beaker-answers pe.conf in those cases.

To work around this, I've added a check, just if we are upgrading to a
Flanders version, which supplies the beaker-answers generated pe.conf.

This patch is just intended to get upgrades from earlier meep versions
working in CI. When we get to PE-18170 (also scheduled for Flanders)
we'll work on improving recover configuration to generate a 2.0 pe.conf,
with the goal being that beaker-answers should not need to provide
anything for pe.conf for Flanders upgrades unless some additional
parameters were added in the beaker configuration.

In BKR-908, code was added to make console timeout checking
configurable. This code relied on `@options` to get the
value from the global option. This works in beaker but not
in beaker-rspec, because `@options` is a TestCase instance
variable. The accessor `options` works in both, because it
is a TestCase accessor in beaker, and a similar method has
been added in beaker-rspec's [shim](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-rspec/blob/master/lib/beaker-rspec/beaker_shim.rb#L26-L28).

* (maint) Add install helpers for pe-client-tools

This commit adds three helper methods to install pe-client-tools on Windows.

The first is a general  method that is designed to abstract
away the installation of pe-client-tools on supported operating systems.
Currently, it only accommodates development builds of the tools based on the
provided SHA and SUITE_VERSION environment variables available.

The second is a generic method to install an msi package on a target host.
Beaker's built in method of this name assumes that msi installed involves the
installation of puppet, so this method overrides that one without such an
assumption.

The this is a generic method to install a dmg package on a target host.
Beaker's built in `install_package` method for osx does not accommodate for an
installer `pkg` file that is named differently from the containing `dmg`. This
method forces the user to supply both names explicitly.

* (maint) Remove install helpers for pe-client-tools

This commit removes the dmg and msi helper methods instroduced earlier.

These two methods have bee moved into beaker.

attempting to evaluate the classes which should be applied to the node.

This commit adds in a sleep and service check to the final agent run
step on the console node which will hopefully work around this issue
until it is fixed in SERVER-1237.

Prior to this commit the condition used to decide whether to use
the `-c`/`-f` flags was dependent on `host['pe_upgrade_ver']` and
`host['pe_ver']` which was an unreliable condition.
This commit updates the condition to determine whether to use the
`-f` flag to simply look at `host['pe_ver']` because that value
is updated depending on what version of pe is currently being
installed or upgraded to.
The condition to decide to omit the `-c` flag has to depend on
`opts[:HOSTS][host.name][:pe_ver]` because that value is not
modified during upgrade and can be used for a valid comparison
to determine if the install will have a `pe.conf` file to use
for an upgrade.

command line options for installation/upgrade.

Additionally, this commit will remove the `-c` parameter being
passed on upgrades from a 2016.2.0+ install, because the installer
should be able to pick up on the existing pe.conf file.

Based on changes pending in puppetlabs/beaker-answers#16, change the
generate_installer_conf_file_for() method to submit the expected :format
option temporarily.  This will go away when we cutover to meep and no
longer have to have both installer scripts operational in the same
build.

Fleshes out the specs that verify the method returns expected answer or
pe.conf data from BeakerAnswers, as written out via scp.

(PE-14271) Prepare host installer options based on version/env

The addition of a use_meep? query allows setting host options for either
legacy or meep installer.  This enables installer_cmd to invoke the
correct installer.

(maint) Remove remaining version_is_less mocks

For consistency, removed the rest of the version_is_less mocks.

In the three cases where this had an impact on the specs, replaced
them with a concrete version setting on the test host object.

(maint) Stop mocking version_is_less in do_install tests

Each change to do_install and supporting methods involving a
version_is_less call was requiring additional mocking simulating
version_is_less's behavior.  This is unnecessary given that hosts are
being set with a version, and actually masks behavior of the class.
Removing these specifically because it was causing churn when
introducing meep functionality.

(PE-14934) Fix specs to cover changes from PE-14934

Introduced chagnes to the do_install method, but specs were failing
because of the tight coupling between expectations and counts of command
execution.

The need to initialize metadata comes from the fact that the previous
PR #3 added step() calls, which reference the TestCase metadata attr.
Since we aren't using an actual TestCase instance, this had to be
initalized separately.

(BKR-656) refactor pe_ver setting into independent method

Previous to this commit, transforming a host object prior to upgrading
was handled in the upgrade_pe_on method. This change removes that logic
from that method and allows for independent transformation to happen in
a new prep_host_for_upgrade method.

the do_install method but did not have any updates for the spec tests.
This commit adds those tests in.

Fixes windows masterless installation

Setting up a masterless windows client would fail with the following error:

Exited: 1
/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/gems/beaker-2.37.0/lib/beaker/host.rb:330:in `exec': Host 'sxrwjhkia9gzo03' exited with 1 running: (Beaker::Host::CommandFailure)
 cmd.exe /c puppet config set server
Last 10 lines of output were:
        Error: puppet config set takes 2 arguments, but you gave 1
        Error: Try 'puppet help config set' for usage

As far as I could see this error is caused by the 'setup_defaults_and_config_helper_on' function which tries to set the master configuration setting in puppet.conf. But since there is no master varaible available this failes.

This patch should fix that by only calling setup_defaults_and_config_helper_on whern we're not doing a masterless installation.

(PE-14934) Add more robust puppetdb check

Before this commit we were still failing before the last puppet agent
run in do_install because we also run puppet agent in some cases before
the last run. This commit adds in the wait during that agent run as well
as a check on the status endpoint in puppetdb to be sure that it is
running in the case that the port is open but puppetdb is not ready for
requests.

Before this commit we were running into an issue where puppetdb would
sometimes not be up and running after puppet agent restarted the
service. This commit waits for the puppetdb service to be up after
running puppet agent on the database node so that the next agent run
doesn't fail.
